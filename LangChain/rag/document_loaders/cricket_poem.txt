Beneath the sun’s unblinking eye,
Two teams meet where dreams can fly,
The pitch, a strip of hardened earth,
Where leather’s clash gives moments birth.

The bowler strides with measured grace,
A storm concealed within his pace,
The seam tilts slightly, dancing sly,
And hope takes wing against the sky.

The bat, held firm with steady hands,
Transforms mere will to bold demands,
A forward press, a crack, a cheer,
The boundary rope is drawing near.

Fielders scatter, swift as light,
In arcs that cut through green delight,
The keeper crouches, sharp and keen,
To snatch the edge, unseen, between.

The umpire stands in white array,
With finger raised, the crowd’s dismay,
Or arms stretched wide to signal more,
As numbers rise upon the score.

Through tea-time talks and summer haze,
Through tense night games and floodlit blaze,
Each ball’s a story, fierce yet sweet,
Where victory’s heart and failure meet.

When stumps are drawn and cheers subside,
The game still hums in every stride,
For cricket’s not just bat and ball,
It’s spirit, courage — love of all.
